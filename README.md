# Abstract

Bacterial efflux pumps are transmembrane protein complexes that extrude a multitude of different substrates from the bacterium. Due to their propensity for the efflux of different antibiotics, efflux pumps play a key role in antibiotic resistance. Therefore, efficient and accurate annotation of the constituent protein subunits that the efflux pumps are comprised of, may prove to be vital in the treatment of future diseases. In this work we set out to create a protocol for the annotation of these efflux pump components, through the use of motif identification. A protein motif is a short consensus sequence of amino acids believed to be present in each member of protein family and thus, capable of giving insight into the function of any protein that contains it. These motifs can be generated by scanning proteins in a family for a highly conserved portion of their sequence. In this work Python was used to search a group of proteomes for the efflux pump motifs. Motif identification proved to be capable of identifying previously unclassified proteins as efflux pump constituents, although the effectiveness of the technique is somewhat hampered by the return of other uncharacterised proteins when looking for homology with potential efflux components identified by the software.

Each efflux pump has the assocatied motif:

# Example Motif parser

Motifs where parser from bacterial proteomes using haskell.
```haskell
fxfaxr :: RE Char Motif
fxfaxr = 
    many anySym *> 
    ((\a b c d e -> a ++ b ++ c ++ d ++ e) <$> 
        (pure  <$> sym 'F') <*> 
        (pure  <$> anySym)  <*> 
        string "FA"         <*>
        (pure  <$> anySym)  <*> 
        (pure  <$> sym 'R'))
    <* many anySym
```
